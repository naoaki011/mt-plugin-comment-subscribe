## Documentation ##

### Setup ###

Add the following to the comment form (often this is thee "Comment Form" 
template in the "Template Modules" section):

    <div id="comment-form-subscribe">
        <label for="comment-subscribe">
            <input type="checkbox" id="comment-subscribe" name="subscribe"
                   checked="checked" />
            Receive email notification of further comments.
        </label>
    </div>

*This code is typically inserted before or after the comment textarea.*

### Customizing the Email's Subject and From Fields

To customize the email address comment notifications will be sent from, as 
well as the subject of comment notifications, navigate to the plugin settings 
area for the Comment Subscribe plugin in the System Plugin listing screen. 
From there, follow the instructions below each of the plugins options.

### Customizing the Email Notification Template

To customize the text of the email notification template, navigate to the 
System's Template Listing screen. A template called "Comment Notification to 
Subscribers" will be listing among your "Email Templates." Edit that template.

The template supports a number of different variables that you can use inside 
the template to customize the text of the email. They are:

   * `entry_title`
   * `entry_permalink`
   * `entry_author`
   * `entry_author_email`
   * `entry_permalink`
   * `comment_author`
   * `comment_text`
   * `unsub_link`

Adding a variable to a template is done using the following syntax:

    <$mt:var name="entry_title"$>

*Please note: law requires that users be given the option to unsubscribe from 
future notifications. Please ensure that the `unsub_link` is always present in 
your template.*
